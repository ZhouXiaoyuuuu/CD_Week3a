# CD_Week3a
The dataset is from 'hollywood_demographics_analysis' of safal312, which aims to explore the effect of the ethnic composition of the lead and supporting cast of Hollywood movies on the box office. There are lots of datasets from his project, while my project of CD_Week3a only focus on one dataset, because obviously I cannot analyze that much.
And this is a preparation for our group final project.
